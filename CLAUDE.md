   - Building the project
   - Running tests (including single test execution)
   - Linting and formatting code
   - Running the application in development mode

2. **Architecture Overview**: As the codebase grows, document:

   - Important cross-cutting concerns
   - Critical dependencies and their purposes

Please update this file when the project structure is established.
